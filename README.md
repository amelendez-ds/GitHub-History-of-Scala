# GitHub-History-of-Scala

## Description
*Data Camp* project for exploring the Scala repository up to 2018. The Scala repository spans data from a version control system (Git) and a project hosting site(GigHub). We will be exploring the almost 30,000 commits over ten years to discover who had more influence on its development and who were those experts. It is an information retrieval mini project that puts in practice **data manipulation**, **data cleaning** and **data visualisation**.

## Data
The dataset includes the project history of [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org) retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files:
- **pulls_2011-2013.csv**
- **pulls_2014-2018.csv**
- **pull_files.csv**
- **pulls.csv**

## Notebook
The notebook comprehends the whole project and is self-contained when the datasets are loaded. Each of its 10 steps has a description on what is being done in the section.

Data and exercises here displayed can all be found in the [Data Camp site](https://www.datacamp.com/).
